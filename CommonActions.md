In color areas, there are a few common actions available:

  * Add to palette (via `Right Click` menu or `Doubleclick`ing)
  * Add all to palette (via `Right Click` menu, if the color is part of a logical grouping of colors -- for example the [Swatches](Swatches.md))
  * Copy to clipboard (via `Right Click` menu)
  * Paste (via `Right Click` menu, if the color area accepts drops)
  * `Drag`: transfer a color to some other area or application. In previews such as in MixColors or [Variations](Variations.md), dragging operations are the only actions available on the color areas.
  * `Ctrl+Drag`: Replace a color in the palette (`ctrl+drag` from some color area onto a palette color. The name will be preserved, the color replaced.)

These actions are available globally:

  * `Ctrl+P    ` Start picking colors with a floating color picker.
  * `Shift+Ctrl+P    ` Show/hide palette.
  * `Ctrl+C    ` Copy currently selected color into clipboard as text. Uses first enabled converter to convert colors. If multiple colors are selected, one line is produced for each color.
  * `Ctrl+N    ` New palette. (if you want another palette open simultaneously, you probably want to open another GPick instance instead; Ctrl+N effects the current instance.)
  * `Ctrl+O    ` Open palette.
  * `Ctrl+R    ` Revert current palette.
  * `Ctrl+S    ` Save current palette. See [SaveAndExport](SaveAndExport.md) for details on saving or exporting to various formats.
  * `Ctrl+E    ` Export current palette.
  * `Shift+Ctrl+E    ` Export selected colors.
  * `Ctrl+I    ` Import colors.
  * `Ctrl+Q    ` Quit GPick.
  * `Shift+Ctrl+N    ` Set secondary view to None.
  * `Shift+Ctrl+B    ` Set secondary view to Blend colors tool.
