# Details #

## Getting newest template.pot file ##
There are several ways to get an updated template:
  * Template file can be generated by executing `scons template` command in the development directory. Template file is generated in "build/" directory. This is preferred method, because you will always have the latest translation file, however this requires source files and some additional tools like "scons", "xgettext".
  * You can download latest template file by clicking the following link: [template.pot](http://wiki.gpick.googlecode.com/hg/translation/template.pot). This file will be updated after each Gpick release.

## Translating into new language ##
"gpick.po" file can be created by using "msginit" program like this:
`msginit --locale=en --input=template.pot --output=gpick.po`.
Alternatively, this can be done by using "poEdit" program:
  * Click on "File->New Catalog from POT File..." menu item.
  * Select "template.pot" file.
  * Fill catalog properties.
  * Save as "gpick.po".

## Updating existing translation ##
"gpick.po" file can be updated by using "msgmerge" program like this:
`msgmerge gpick.po template.pot > new_gpick.po`
Alternatively, this can be done by using "poEdit" program:
  * Open "gpick.po" with "poEdit".
  * Click on "Catalog->Update from POT file..." menu item.
  * Select "template.pot" file.

## Submitting translations ##
Either create a new issue and attach your translation to it, or e-mail the translated "gpick.po" file to [mailto:thezbyg@gmail.com](mailto:thezbyg@gmail.com).
