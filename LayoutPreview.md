Layout Preview is quite simple. A layout preview is displayed, you can drop colors on any area (including the text) to recolor it.
You can choose which type of preview to work with (Grid 4x3, Grid 5x4, Menu, Webpage).

When you add the colors to your palette (probably using "Add all to Palette"), if you have 'tool color naming' set to 'tool specific',
the names will be easily understandable, for example "layout preview content\_t" "layout preview navitem\_t" "layout preview navitem\_b".

'Layout Preview' is also available as a secondary panel, so you can compare two color schemes.
