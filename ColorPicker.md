There are two types of color picker in GPick. The embedded picker — the one which is part of the window,
and the floating picker.

The embedded picker is easy to use — just press `Space `when the pointer is over the area you want to pick from. By contrast, the floating picker is more flexible — in particular it's more accommodating of window managers that use 'sloppy mouse focus', and almost as easy to use (press `Ctrl+P`, `drag` from the central cell in the swatch, or `drag` from the GPick icon in the system tray).
The result always (at minimum) is stored in the active [swatch](Swatches.md) slot

You can [set individually](Preferences.md) for each:
  * Whether the result should be added to the palette
  * Whether the result should be copied to the clipboard

In addition, for the embedded color picker, you can also choose whether it should rotate the active [swatch](Swatches.md) slot; this will allow you to pick up to 6 colors in succession and have them fill successive slots in the [swatches](Swatches.md)

The current sampling setting are shown in the `Color picker` tab of the main pane, under `Settings`
